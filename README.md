# phpBBscripts
Small repo with some scripts to do stuff on a phpBB forum. 

scraper.py will find all the posts made by a certain user and will save the content of the posts on a text file.

poster.py will login as a user and post a reply to a topic, selected randomly from the acrive topics list. The content of the post will be generated by a Markov chain based on a certain corpus file (generated for example by the previous script).

The code is ugly but it works, or at least it works on the specific forum I tried it.
